## How to run the app

### 1. Set the API_KEY

* Login or register at openweathermap.org and copy your API Key
  from https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys
* Download this project's code
* Create a keys.properties file in the root folder of the project (e.g.,
  AndroidStudioProjects\weather\keys.properties)
* Add the API key into the keys.properties in this format: `API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`

### 2. Set the API_BASE_URL and ICONS_BASE_URL

* Copy the following lines:
    ```
      API_BASE_URL="https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/"
      ICONS_BASE_URL="https://openweathermap.org/img/wn/"
    ```
* Paste them as additional entries to the keys.properties file
* Expect the API to distinguish between day and night by including a sun or moon accordingly in
  their icon during the following weather conditions: clear sky, few clouds, and rain.
